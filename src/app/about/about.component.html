        Hi, Iâ€™m Adam Rafraf, a final-year Computer Engineering student with a focus on game development, web
        technologies, and automation.
      <p>
        My journey includes developing interactive games, mobile apps, and efficient deployment systems, always
        prioritizing intuitive design and cutting-edge tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, Angular, and Jenkins.
