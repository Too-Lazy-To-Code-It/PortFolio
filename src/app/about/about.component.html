        Hello! My name is Adam Rafraf and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in [year] when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

        Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at [an advertising agency/a start-up/a huge corporation/a student-led design studio]. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at [Company Name] for a variety of clients.

        Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

      <ul class="skills-list">
        @for (skill of skills; track skill) {
          <li>{{ skill }}</li>
        }
      </ul>
